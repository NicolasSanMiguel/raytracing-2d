# raytracing-2d

These files create a point source of rays located in a field with five random walls. 
Rays are emitted from the point source and terminate when they intersect one of the walls or the sides of the screen.
The point source can be adjusted to follow the user's mouse or to randomly move about the window.

How to install and run:
1. Clone the repo onto your local computer
2. Run the .html file in a web engine (I used Google Chrome)
